If you're using iOS >= 6 and you have mountain lion (10.8) or Safari >= 6, you can just:

1. Open the application in the simulator (or your device in XCode >= 4.5.x).
2. Open Safari on your Mac: Go to `Preferences` -> `Advanced` and make sure "`Show Develop Menu in Menubar`" is on.
3. From the Menu bar (of Safari) select `Develop -> iPhone Simulator -> [your webview page]`.

That's it!
