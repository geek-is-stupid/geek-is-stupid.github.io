Someday your boss ask you to have staging server and production server to make data be pure, so you will find out this code for your api:

```swift
var host: NSURL {
    #if DEBUG
        return NSURL(string: "https://www.google.com.vn")!
    #else
        return NSURL(string: "http://geek-is-stupid.github.io")!
    #endif
}
```

And you go to `Build Settings` and set the `DEBUG` symbol in Swift `Compiler - Custom Flags` section for the `Other Swift Flags` key via a `-D DEBUG` entry. See the following screenshot for an example:

That works, hummm but what happen if I move the host to a library and I use CocoaPods to manages dependencies, it wonâ€™t work any more.

So the way to let it jump :)

Open your Podfile and add this script to the bottom:

```swift
post_install do |installer|
    installer.pods_project.build_configurations.each do |config|
        if config.name == 'Debug'
            config.build_settings['OTHER_SWIFT_FLAGS'] ||= ['$(inherited)', '-D DEBUG']
        elsif config.name == 'Release'
            config.build_settings['OTHER_SWIFT_FLAGS'] ||= ['$(inherited)', '-D RELEASE']
        end
    end
end
```
