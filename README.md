### 🆕 How to create a new post:
To create a new post, all you need to do is create a file in the `_posts` directory. How you name files in this folder is important. Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

```
YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP
```
or
```
YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.md
```

For e.g:

```
2011-12-31-new-years-eve-is-awesome.md
2012-09-12-how-to-write-a-blog.md
```
